            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received yours with Intimations of your kind Acceptance of the laſt Specifick that I communicated to you, and with an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to proceed in ſo uſefull an undertaking: And I do aſſure you, that ſeeing your ſelf and ſome great Phyſicians in <hi>London,</hi> are ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55935:3"/>well pleaſed with what I have done in this Kind, I am reſolved to go on, and tell you what Experiments I have made in the uſe of Simple Medicines. I remember Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> tells us, that the Legiſlators amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> made a ſevere Law againſt the uſe of Compound Medicines. I my ſelf have known ſuch great Cures wrought by Simple Medicines, that I am under a great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deſpiſe Compoſitions, except in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>For my part I firmly believe, that (uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Evacuations being premiſed) the greateſt Cures wrought in the World, are by the uſe of Specifical Medicines, and yet I have this fifty years been an exact Obſerver of the <hi>Methodus Medendi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never yet found a better Medicine againſt the <hi>Green Sickneſs</hi> than the <hi>Bermudas</hi> Berries, taken familiarly in any Liquor; but I find the Tincture of it made with White-wine, and alſo the Spirits and Extract of the ſame, more efficacious than any other Form.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55935:3"/>
            <p>They wonderfully open the Obſtructions of the Liver and Spleen, mend an ill habit of Body, cures the Green Sickneſs, by refining the Maſs of Blood, and reſtoring the Ferments to the Parts; it helps digeſtion, and removes a depraved Appetite, deſiring hurtfull things: it clears the Cloudineſs of the Skin, and mends the Complexion, and unloads an oppreſſed Stomack of thoſe indigeſted humours which corrupt good Nouriſhment, and cauſe ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Breath and Stoppages.</p>
            <p>A Gentlewoman ahout Twenty Eight years of Age, who was troubled with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and her Complexion extreamly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, her Lips and Cheeks turned as white as a Cloth, her Eyes and Face bloated, her Legs ſwelled, and the Regular Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtopped; after ſhe had taken great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Powder of Steel to no purpoſe, ſhe took the Tincture, Spirit and Extract drawn out of theſe Berryes, Morning, Noon and Night, and her Stomack mended, her Colour return'd like a Roſe in <hi>June,</hi> and ſhe could
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55935:4"/>with pleaſure run up four pair of Stairs at a time: She took the Tincture in Beer, the Spirit in White-wine, and the Extract in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyroyal Water.</p>
            <p>We have in our Countrey a large Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-School of young Gentlewomen, and I have known half a ſcore of them at a time afflicted with this uncomfortable Diſtemper, which made them uneaſie to themſelves, and unpleaſant to their Relations; and in one Courſe of the Moon, by the uſe of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines drawn out of theſe Berries, they were recover'd to a Miracle, and grew chearfull and healthfull: But all Remedies in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper are moſt efficacious when uſed with Exerciſe.</p>
            <p>I knew one Gentlewoman, whole caſe was by moſt Phyſicians thought to be paſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, being brought by this Diſtemper to the brink of the Grave; her Fleſh was waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, her Legs ſwelled, her Stomack loſt, and her Legs ſo weak, not able to ſupport her body; yet in the uſe of theſe Berries ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55935:4"/>and lived to be a hale woman, and had many Children.</p>
            <p>And now becauſe I know your Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Inclination, I'll tell you a remarkable Obſervation lately made by me upon a young Virgin, who dyed of this Diſeaſe, ſhe was extreamly far gone into the Green Sickneſs, loſt her Strength and Spirits, had taken great quantities of Powder of Steel, been blooded in the Foot twice, and at length dying; upon Diſſection we found a Mortification in her Stomack and Bowels, cauſed by a ſharp corroding Humour, which cauſed very acute Pains in her Body: Had I been called to her, I ſhould certainly have applyed theſe Remedies, and I have great reaſon to believe they might have proved ſerviceable: if you think fit to recommend the uſe of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of your Acquaintance, I don't doubt but they may be procured at <hi>London.</hi>
